## Blockchain-Enabled Predictive Tool for Satellite Management

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to predict potential satellite downtimes by analyzing historical logs, identifies causes of failures, and aiding in proactive decision making. It secures sensitive data using blockchain(Hyperledger Fabric), ensuring tamper-proof records and authorized access. Its efficiency lies in enabling timely interventions, reducing unanticipated failures, and enhancing satellite operation reliability.

## Features

- Satellite telemetry monitoring

- Predictive analysis based on historical satellite data using supervised learning algorithm

- Anomaly detection based on predefined thresholds 

- Secure storage of telemetry logs and alerts on Hyperledger Fabric

- Smart contract (chaincode) triggered alerts for detected anomalies

- REST API integration for seamless backend communication

- Flask-based Web Application for dashboard visualization and monitoring

## Proposed Technologies

- Python: Data processing and backend logic

- Flask: Web server and REST API handling

- Docker & Docker Compose: Containerization of services

- Hyperledger Fabric: Blockchain network for secure data storage

- Pandas, NumPy: Telemetry data analysis
